### Skill Gained 
####  Artificial Neural Network
####  Backpropagation
####  Python Programming
####  Deep Learning
This is a must do course for any one interested in Neural Networks. It will give a great understanding of the role of different layers of NN.   
And also one will be learning the python code to build a model using fully connected Deep Neural Network.Learn the vectorization computation and key parameters in neural network's architecture.
The interviews with pioneers in this field are worth watching.   
The course is presented be Andrew Ng and he has an art to make difficult things very easy and understandable.
