# coursera-courses-certifications
This repository contains certificates related to online courses I have done:   
## 1. Introduction to Search Engine Optimization(20-02-2017)     
## 2. Problem Solving with Excel (07-09-2018)   
## 3. Mastering Data Analysis with Excel (29-10-2018)
This is very interesting course to have a basic idea how analysis is done in the field of Machine Learning. Concepts are hard to grasp as lot of information is provided, and it needs a lot of practice and patience to complete the assignments. 
The assignments are not easy to solve.
## 4. The Data Scientist's Toolbox (02-12-2018)
## 5. Neural Networks and Deep Learning (20-06-2020)
This is a must do course for any one interested in Neural Networks. It will give a great understanding of the role of different layers of NN.   
And also one will be learning the python code to build a model using fully connected Deep Neural Network.Learn the vectorization computation and key parameters in neural network's architecture.
The interviews with pioneers in this field are worth watching.   
The course is presented be Andrew Ng and he has an art to make difficult things very easy and understandable.
